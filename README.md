# License plate recognition project
This project is part of my graduation requirement at Bangkok University. It originated from my travels where I noticed that the existing automatic barrier systems had certain drawbacks. Some of these systems were slow and time-consuming, while others had been in place for decades without updates. Consequently, our aim is to develop a new system that can be regularly updated to address any encountered issues. This will make the technology more convenient and reduce wasted time.
